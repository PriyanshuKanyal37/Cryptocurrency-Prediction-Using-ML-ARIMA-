Project Name
Cryptocurrency-Prediction-Using-ML-ARIMA

Description
This model implements a time series forecasting technique known as SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) for predicting the next day's price of Bitcoin (BTC) based on historical price and volume data. It combines autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components to analyze patterns and trends in the cryptocurrency market. The model utilizes features such as open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume to generate predictions. It is trained on historical data and evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its predictive performance. The aim of this model is to provide insights into short-term price movements of Bitcoin, aiding investors and traders in decision-making.
